Learning About Linux

Introduction:
This document explains important things about Linux, including its history, popular versions (called distributions), and some basic commands.

Section 1: Linux History

Linux was created in 1991 by Linus Torvalds as a free and open alternative to expensive systems like Unix. Inspired by the GNU Project, Linux started small but grew fast because it was free, safe, and flexible.

Today, Linux is used everywhere — from smartphones (like Android) to big servers and supercomputers. It is now a key part of modern technology, running much of the internet and helping new technologies like cloud computing and artificial intelligence grow.

 Section 2: Linux Distributions

A Linux distribution (or distro) is a version of Linux that includes the Linux core (kernel), tools, and programs, making it easy to install and use. Different distros are made for different uses.

Popular Linux distributions include:
- Ubuntu: Easy to use, great for regular users and servers.
- Debian: Known for being very stable, it is used to make other distros.
- Fedora: Focuses on new features and updates, supported by Red Hat.
- Arch Linux: Lightweight and customizable, made for advanced users.

Each distro has different features and tools, allowing users to pick the one that fits their needs and skill level.


Section 3: Basic Linux Commands

Here are some simple and useful Linux commands:

- ls: Shows the files and folders in the current folder.
  ls

-cd: Changes the folder you are in.
  cd /folder

- pwd: Shows which folder you are currently in.
  pwd

- mkdir: Creates a new folder.
  mkdir folder_name

- cp: Copies files or folders.
  cp source_file destination


-mv: Moves or renames files or folders. 
  mv old_name new_name
  

-rm: Deletes files or folders.
  rm file_name
 

-sudo: Runs a command with admin (superuser) permissions.
  sudo command


These commands help you manage and move around a Linux system easily.

:Summary
We learned about Linux, its history, different versions (distributions), and some basic commands. Linux started in 1991 and is now used in many areas like the internet, servers, and phones. We also looked at simple commands to move around and manage files.

:Why Linux is Important
Learning Linux is useful because it’s used everywhere — from websites to smartphones. It’s free, secure, and flexible. Knowing Linux can help you get jobs in tech and work on many different systems.
